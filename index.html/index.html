      <img src="images/profile.jpg.JPG" alt="Hello,My name is Liz ALejandra Albancando Robles" width="200">
      <p>Hello! My name is Liz Albancando. I was born in Bogota, Colombia. I enjoy playing the piano, violin and sing, learning new things, 
        dancing and traveling. I also enjoy cooking and baking. Part of this is very important to me because what I eat plays a big 
        role in how I feel and the energy I feel to put into things. 
        I work out often and thats why I also like to keep a balance diet where food is teasty but also healthy.
        I have 5 siblings and I am the number three. I consider myself very social and also I can adjust to enviroments where I can 
        also be just with myself.
        I have been thinking to study programming and even it took me a little bit to decide, I have most of my siblings studying
        simmilar things, so they have been encoraging me and sometimes being as a tutor.
        I see myself as a developer in the future. 
        I want to be able to work with machine learning on data and projects where the programs are design to make changes 
        in the physical enviroment.  
        I know Sofware Development has a huge area where I could find different oportunities for work where I will find more 
        enjoyable. I am not there yet, but I have been putting enough time and energy to learn and practice as much as I can.</p>
